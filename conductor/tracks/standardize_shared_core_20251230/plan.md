# Track Plan: Standardize Shared Components and Core Patterns

## Phase 1: Core Service Standardization
Standardize the foundation services and guards in the `core` directory.

- [x] Task: Standardize `ThemeService` with Signals 198c095
    - [ ] Write Tests (TDD)
    - [ ] Implement/Refactor Service
- [x] Task: Standardize `UserService` with Signals 41ec948
    - [ ] Write Tests (TDD)
    - [ ] Implement/Refactor Service
- [ ] Task: Standardize `AuthService` and `AuthGuard`
    - [ ] Write Tests (TDD)
    - [ ] Implement/Refactor Service and Guard
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Core Service Standardization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Shared Component Standardization
Standardize the common UI components in the `shared` directory.

- [ ] Task: Standardize `EmptyStateComponent`
    - [ ] Write Tests (TDD)
    - [ ] Implement/Refactor Component
- [ ] Task: Standardize `PageHeaderComponent`
    - [ ] Write Tests (TDD)
    - [ ] Implement/Refactor Component
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Shared Component Standardization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Final Integration and Documentation
Ensure everything is correctly linked and documented.

- [ ] Task: Update public API exports in `index.ts` files
- [ ] Task: Verify JSDoc documentation across all standardized files
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Final Integration and Documentation' (Protocol in workflow.md)
